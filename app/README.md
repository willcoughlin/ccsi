This is the frontend application that helps make sense of all the data collected. The application is written with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and utilizes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS (and none of its Javascript).

Some highlighted dependencies include:
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) - for ES6 and JSX compilation.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - for efficient bundling.
* [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) - for use with Webpack to bundle CSS.
